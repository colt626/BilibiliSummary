## How to Use
Log in to Bilibili, click on a video, and then click the BilibiliSummary icon to start generating a video summary. Our extension will analyze the video content within 5 seconds and generate a short but detailed video summary, telling you the main content and key points of the video. You can choose to watch the entire video or just quickly browse the summary according to your needs.

### Notes
Do not close the ChatGPT tab, as this will interrupt your service.

Because we use subtitles for parsing, it is not suitable to use an APIKEY that charges by the number of words. This method will not consume your APIKEY and will not cost you any money, of course, it will not cost me any money either.


### Usage
Download the dist.zip from Releases and then unzip and install it.
